Intention is to automate blog post creations:

- write in a plain text file and turn into html file

- push to github

Doubts about how to automate natural language to html labels. First, just try with plain text and expand to include imgs, quotes, links, strong, italics, code

Next steps: Create templates for new posts in index and for the posts themselves.
